# Data Manipulation with dplyr

## What is dplyr?
  
The `dplyr` package is quickly becoming the de-facto standard for common tasks that involve manipulating data frames. Some of its biggest advantages are: 
  
  - A streamlined and unified interface for tasks commonly performed together. 
  - More syntactically and semantically intuitive functions than the tools in base R
  - Often much faster!
  - The ability to manipulate data stored in databases (e.g. MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) with the same language you use for 'ordinary' data in R (i.e., data frames).
  
This is not to say that it replaces or makes base R syntax obsolete, but it is a great tool to have at your disposal.

---

## Functions == Verbs in dplyr
`dplyr` provides some basic "verbs", i.e., functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks. 

This model helps build a bridge between your thoughts (i.e., what you want to do to the data, like "I want to select only observations from the first time point") into code. For example:

- "I want to sort the rows" --&gt; `arrange()`
- "I want to select only some rows" --&gt; `filter()`
- "I want to select only some columns" --&gt; `select()`
- "I want to find the unique rows" --&gt; `distinct()`
- "I want to create a new column" --&gt; `mutate()`
- "I want to aggregate the data" --&gt; `summarize()`

---

## Getting Started
We'll start our tour by installing the `dplyr` package and loading a dataset to use in our examples.


```r
install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
cropYield &lt;- read.csv("http://wjhopper.github.io/psych640-labs/data/crops.csv",
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(cropYield)
```


```
##   Field   Till    Fert Yield
## 1     1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2     1 Chisel    Deep   130
## 3     1 Chisel Surface   123
## 4     2 Chisel   Broad   135
## 5     2 Chisel    Deep   148
## 6     2 Chisel Surface   134
```

The `cropYield` data frame has 99 observations of 4 variables: Field, Till,	Fert,	and Yield.

---

## The arrange function
The `arrange` function sorts the rows of a data frame based on the values of one or more variables. Lets use it to sort the rows of the `cropYield` data frame by fertilizer type.

`arrange` expects the first argument to be the data frame to sort, and uses any remaining arguments as the names of the variables to sort by.

```r
arrange(cropYield, Fert) # Column names are unquoted!!
```

```
##   Field   Till  Fert Yield
## 1     1 Chisel Broad   119
## 2     2 Chisel Broad   135
## 3     3 Chisel Broad   140
## 4     4 Chisel Broad   126
## 5     5 Chisel Broad   128
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 94 rows ]
```

---

## The arrange function
If you ask `arrange` to sort by multiple variables, the rows are sorted hierarchically according to the order of the variables listed in the function call. 


```r
arrange(cropYield, Fert, Yield)
```

```
##   Field   Till  Fert Yield
## 1     7 Chisel Broad   104
## 2     8 Chisel Broad   108
## 3    26  Ridge Broad   110
## 4    12 Chisel Broad   114
## 5    23  Ridge Broad   115
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 94 rows ]
```

---

## The arrange function
You can also sort by reverse alphabetical or numerically descending order by using the `desc` function (short for descending) inside the call to `arrange`.


```r
arrange(cropYield, Fert, desc(Yield)) # desc only works inside arrange
```

```
##   Field    Till  Fert Yield
## 1    16 Moldbrd Broad   160
## 2    24   Ridge Broad   156
## 3    33   Ridge Broad   153
## 4    20 Moldbrd Broad   147
## 5    11  Chisel Broad   146
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 94 rows ]
```

---

## The filter function
The `filter` function selects a subset of rows from the data frame based on logical tests, similar to the `[` operator.

`filter` also expects the first argument to be a data frame. Any other arguments must be expressions that return logical vectors, and `filter` returns only the rows where the logical conditions are met.


```r
# Find the rows where the tilling method is ridge
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge")
```

```
##   Field  Till    Fert Yield
## 1    23 Ridge   Broad   115
## 2    23 Ridge    Deep   142
## 3    23 Ridge Surface   148
## 4    24 Ridge   Broad   156
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 29 rows ]
```

---

## The filter function
If you list multiple conditions, they are combined with the `&amp;` operator, meaning that a row must meet *both* conditions to be included in the output. 

Here, a row must have it's `Till` value equal to `Ridge`, and it's `Fert` value equal to `Deep` to be part of the output.

```r
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge", Fert == "Deep")
```

```
##   Field  Till Fert Yield
## 1    23 Ridge Deep   142
## 2    24 Ridge Deep   174
## 3    25 Ridge Deep   144
## 4    26 Ridge Deep   128
## 5    27 Ridge Deep   153
## 6    28 Ridge Deep   165
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 5 rows ]
```

---

## The filter function
If you want to include a row if it meets *any* given condition (a logical `OR` statement), you must combine the conditions yourself with the `|` operator.


```r
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge" | Fert == "Deep") 
```

```
##   Field   Till Fert Yield
## 1     1 Chisel Deep   130
## 2     2 Chisel Deep   148
## 3     3 Chisel Deep   146
## 4     4 Chisel Deep   132
## 5     5 Chisel Deep   141
## 6     6 Chisel Deep   130
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 49 rows ]
```

---

## Common Filtering Mistakes
Filtering right can be hard! No, seriously! Conceptual mistakes often occur when trying to translate verbal requirements into R code, because words like "and" have such strict operational definitions in R.

Consider this example: Someone asks you to analyze just the data from the "Ridge" and "Chisel" methods of tilling. You realize your first step is to filter down your data to just those two types of observations.

And, you first instinct might be to take the "and" in "Ridge and Chisel" literally, and try something like this:


```r
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge" &amp; "Chisel")
```

---

## Common Filtering Mistakes
But there are two mistakes here. First, you would need to specify the `Till ==` variable on *both* sides of the `&amp;` - remember, the `&amp;` operator chains together two logical values, and `"Chisel"` is not a logical value.


```r
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge" &amp; Till == "Chisel")
```

```
## [1] Field Till  Fert  Yield
## &lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)
```

--

But even though the code runs, we get no output because this is a *conceptual* mistake.

You want both the "Ridge" and "Chisel" observations in your final output, but think about this: how does R control what gets included in the final output? 

It goes row, by row, by row, saying "you're in, you're in, you're out, you're in" etc. But, you've just asked for something impossible - you've asked it to include values where the `Till` variable has the the value "Chisel" **and** the value "Ridge" **at the same time** - which should never happen!!

---

## Common Filtering Mistakes
So even though we verbally ask for "Ridge and Chisel", we need to ask R for "**Either** Ridge or Chisel". In other words, we need to tell R that a value of "Chisel" **or** a value of "Ridge" mean the row should be included in the output.

We do this with the `|` logical operator.


```r
filter(cropYield, Till == "Ridge" | Till == "Chisel")[c(1:2, 45:46),]
```

```
##    Field   Till    Fert Yield
## 1      1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2      1 Chisel    Deep   130
## 45    25  Ridge Surface   145
## 46    26  Ridge   Broad   110
```

---

## Filtering with `%in%`
In this situation, the best thing to do is rely on set-based matching with the `%in%` operator.

So, if you want to include rows where the value of a variable takes on one of many allowable values (e.g., rows where `x` is 1 or 2, instead of just 1, or rows where `Till` is "Ridge" or "Chisel"), you can use the `%in%` operator.


```r
filter(cropYield, Till %in% c("Ridge", "Chisel"))
```

```
##   Field   Till    Fert Yield
## 1     1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2     1 Chisel    Deep   130
## 3     1 Chisel Surface   123
## 4     2 Chisel   Broad   135
## 5     2 Chisel    Deep   148
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 64 rows ]
```

---

## The select function
The `select` function allows you to pare down your data set by only keeping the columns that you specify, and also allows you to rename and reorder the selected columns on the fly.

When you rename a column, the existing column name goes on the right of the `=`, and the new name goes on the left - just like assigning a new variable!

```r
colnames(cropYield) # just for our reference
```

```
## [1] "Field" "Till"  "Fert"  "Yield"
```

```r
select(cropYield, fertilizer = Fert, bushels = Yield, Till)
```

```
##   fertilizer bushels   Till
## 1      Broad     119 Chisel
## 2       Deep     130 Chisel
## 3    Surface     123 Chisel
## 4      Broad     135 Chisel
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 95 rows ]
```

---

## The select function
The `select` function even allows you to select a continuous range of columns using the start and end column names, separated with the `:` operator, just like a numeric vector!!!

```r
# So awesome! But, you can't rename at the same time with this syntax
select(cropYield, Till:Yield)
```

```
##     Till    Fert Yield
## 1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2 Chisel    Deep   130
## 3 Chisel Surface   123
## 4 Chisel   Broad   135
## 5 Chisel    Deep   148
## 6 Chisel Surface   134
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 93 rows ]
```

---

## The select function
You can even specify just the columns you *don't* want to keep, which is useful for very wide data frames where you want to discard just one or two columns

```r
# The - says to drop this column
select(cropYield, -Field)
```

```
##     Till    Fert Yield
## 1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2 Chisel    Deep   130
## 3 Chisel Surface   123
## 4 Chisel   Broad   135
## 5 Chisel    Deep   148
## 6 Chisel Surface   134
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 93 rows ]
```

---

## The rename function
You can use the `rename` function if you want to change any column names without removing any columns.

```r
# Existing column name on the right of the =, new name on the left 
rename(cropYield, fieldID = Field)
```

```
##   fieldID   Till    Fert Yield
## 1       1 Chisel   Broad   119
## 2       1 Chisel    Deep   130
## 3       1 Chisel Surface   123
## 4       2 Chisel   Broad   135
## 5       2 Chisel    Deep   148
## 6       2 Chisel Surface   134
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 93 rows ]
```

---

## The mutate function
You can use the mutate function to create new variables in your data frame.

Its especially useful for creating new variables based on existing ones, and changing/adding multiple columns at the same time.


```r
mutate(cropYield, Field = factor(Field), yeildSq = Yield^2)
```

```
##   Field   Till    Fert Yield yeildSq
## 1     1 Chisel   Broad   119   14161
## 2     1 Chisel    Deep   130   16900
## 3     1 Chisel Surface   123   15129
## 4     2 Chisel   Broad   135   18225
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 95 rows ]
```

---

## The mutate function
A cool feature of the `mutate` function is that you can use new variables immediately after you create them, within the same call to mutate!!


```r
# We create  yieldRoot, and then use it in the same function call
mutate(cropYield, yeild_sqrd = Yield^2, orig_yield = sqrt(Yield))
```

```
##   Field   Till    Fert Yield yeild_sqrd orig_yield
## 1     1 Chisel   Broad   119      14161   10.90871
## 2     1 Chisel    Deep   130      16900   11.40175
## 3     1 Chisel Surface   123      15129   11.09054
## 4     2 Chisel   Broad   135      18225   11.61895
##  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 95 rows ]
```

---

## The distinct function
The `distinct` function returns only the unique rows of a data frame.

Lets use it to discover all the unique combinations of `Till` and `Fert` contained in this dataset.


```r
distinct(select(cropYield, Till, Fert))
```

```
##      Till    Fert
## 1  Chisel   Broad
## 2  Chisel    Deep
## 3  Chisel Surface
## 4 Moldbrd   Broad
## 5 Moldbrd    Deep
## 6 Moldbrd Surface
## 7   Ridge   Broad
## 8   Ridge    Deep
## 9   Ridge Surface
```

---

## The summarize function
The `summarize` function is useful for applying functions that reduce your variables down to a single value.


```r
summarize(cropYield, total_yield = sum(Yield))
```

```
##   total_yield
## 1       13854
```

**Important**: when you do use `summarize` on a data frame, your output will only have your new summary variables (e.g., `total_yield`).

---

## The summarize function

You can compute multiple summary statistics at once in the summarize function


```r
summarize(cropYield,
          total_yield = sum(Yield),
          median_yield = median(Yield),
          min_yield = min(Yield)
          )
```

```
##   total_yield median_yield min_yield
## 1       13854          141       104
```

The summarize function may not seem incredibly useful on its own, but allows us to segue into what is perhaps the biggest reason to use `dplyr`.

---

## The Killer Feature of dplyr
Unless you are struggling to work with a remote MySQL server, or waiting hours for your code to run on data frames with millions of observations, it might not seem worth it to "relearn" how to do everything the "dplyr way".

But `dplyr` has one feature that makes it worth every minute of learning:

The ability to define persistent groups in your data frame, and apply functions to *each individual group, instead of the entire data frame*.

This silver bullet is given to us by the `group_by` function.

---

## Group-wise operations, the hard way
Let's try to find find the total crop yield for each tilling and fertilizer combination:


```r
ChiselBroad &lt;- sum(cropYield$Yield[cropYield$Till == 'Chisel'
                    &amp; cropYield$Fert == 'Broad'])
ChiselBroad
```

```
## [1] 1491
```

```r
ChiselDeep &lt;- sum(cropYield$Yield[cropYield$Till == 'Chisel'
                   &amp; cropYield$Fert == 'Deep'])
ChiselDeep
```

```
## [1] 1605
```

```r
ChiselSurface &lt;- sum(cropYield$Yield[cropYield$Till == 'Chisel'
                      &amp; cropYield$Fert == 'Surface'])
ChiselSurface # And so on for 6 more groups!!
```

```
## [1] 1577
```
This is verbose, tedious, prone to typos, and doesn't scale to large datasets with many groups.

---

## The group_by function
With `group_by`, you can specify sub-groups in your data by saying which variables in your data frame define groups of observations. For example, we can group the `cropYield` data frame into 9 smaller groups, one for each of the tilling and fertilizer combinations.


```r
cropsGrouped &lt;- group_by(cropYield, Till, Fert) # store the grouped dataset
cropsGrouped
```

```
## # A tibble: 99 x 4
## # Groups:   Till, Fert [9]
##    Field Till   Fert    Yield
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
##  1     1 Chisel Broad     119
##  2     1 Chisel Deep      130
##  3     1 Chisel Surface   123
##  4     2 Chisel Broad     135
##  5     2 Chisel Deep      148
##  6     2 Chisel Surface   134
##  7     3 Chisel Broad     140
##  8     3 Chisel Deep      146
##  9     3 Chisel Surface   142
## 10     4 Chisel Broad     126
## # … with 89 more rows
```

---

## The group_by function
The `group_by` function doesn't change the external appearance of the data frame; the only noticeable change is the addition of the line `Groups: Till, Fert [9]` when the data frame is printed.

```r
cropsGrouped # Inspect the grouped dataset
```

```
## # A tibble: 99 x 4
## # Groups:   Till, Fert [9]
##    Field Till   Fert    Yield
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
##  1     1 Chisel Broad     119
##  2     1 Chisel Deep      130
##  3     1 Chisel Surface   123
##  4     2 Chisel Broad     135
##  5     2 Chisel Deep      148
##  6     2 Chisel Surface   134
##  7     3 Chisel Broad     140
##  8     3 Chisel Deep      146
##  9     3 Chisel Surface   142
## 10     4 Chisel Broad     126
## # … with 89 more rows
```

This line tells you which columns the groups are based on, and how many individual groups they form.

---

## Group-wise operations, the easy way
When `dplyr` functions are applied to a grouped data frame, the operations you perform are no longer applied to the entire data frame.

Instead, they are applied to **each group** of observations individually!!

This technique makes finding the mean of each individual tilling/fertilizer group incredibly simple instead of complicated and tedious. Observe:


```r
cropsGrouped &lt;- group_by(cropYield, Till, Fert) # easy peasy
group_sums &lt;- summarize(cropsGrouped, total_yield = sum(Yield)) # lemon squeezy
```

The `group_sums` data frame now holds 9 different sums - one for each tilling and fertilizing combination!

---

## Group-wise operations, the easy way
Viola!

```r
group_sums
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   Till [3]
##   Till    Fert    total_yield
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Chisel  Broad          1491
## 2 Chisel  Deep           1605
## 3 Chisel  Surface        1577
## 4 Moldbrd Broad          1408
## 5 Moldbrd Deep           1510
## 6 Moldbrd Surface        1460
## 7 Ridge   Broad          1408
## 8 Ridge   Deep           1710
## 9 Ridge   Surface        1685
```

--

**Important**: when you do use `summarize` on a grouped data frame, your output will only have your grouping variables, and your new summary variables.

---

## Group-wise operations
Lets take a closer look at meta-data about our summary data frame.

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   Till [3]
##   Till    Fert    total_yield
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Chisel  Broad          1491
## 2 Chisel  Deep           1605
## 3 Chisel  Surface        1577
## 4 Moldbrd Broad          1408
## # … with 5 more rows
```
The `Groups` line at the top has changed: now our data frame is only grouped by `Till`, and the group size is now `[?]`.

This is because `summarize` always "peels off" the final grouping variable, because it doesn't make sense to continue grouping by the same columns. If you did, each group size would be one, because you just summarized each group down to one value.

---

## Group-wise operations
You can use the `n` function, with no arguments, inside calls to `summarize` and `mutate` to count the number of observations in a group.

```r
summarize(cropsGrouped, grpSize = n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 9 x 3
## # Groups:   Till [3]
##   Till    Fert    grpSize
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Chisel  Broad        12
## 2 Chisel  Deep         12
## 3 Chisel  Surface      12
## 4 Moldbrd Broad        10
## # … with 5 more rows
```

---

## Ungrouping
If you want to remove the grouping you've applied to a data frame, just use the `ungroup` function to reset it back to a "normal" data frame.


```r
ungroup(cropsGrouped) # no more "Groups" line
```

```
## # A tibble: 99 x 4
##   Field Till   Fert    Yield
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1 Chisel Broad     119
## 2     1 Chisel Deep      130
## 3     1 Chisel Surface   123
## 4     2 Chisel Broad     135
## # … with 95 more rows
```
You can check a data frames grouped/ungrouped status with the `is.grouped` function.

---

## Pipes

In the first slide, I told you dplyr provides "a streamlined and unified interface for tasks commonly performed together", and now I'm going back that claim up.

As you may have noticed, all dplyr functions take a data frame as their first argument, and return a data frame as their output.  This is because dplyr functions are designed to be chained together and used in sequence.

The `dplyr` package provides the pipe operator, written `%&gt;%` for this specific purpose: chaining together individual functions together to form a data manipulation pipeline.

---

## Pipes

The `%&gt;%` operator is actually pretty simple - it takes the output of the function on its left, and send it as input to the function on its right. And even though it was designed to work with dplyr functions, it works anywhere in R!


```r
sqrt(5) # Standard syntax

## A data analysis pipeline
Here's an example of data analysis "pipeline" - a series of related operations intended to be performed in sequence


```r
crops &lt;- select(cropYield, -Field)
crops &lt;- filter(crops, Till %in% c("Ridge", "Chisel"))
crops &lt;- group_by(crops, Till, Fert)
summarize(crops, total_yeild = sum(Yield))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
## # Groups:   Till [2]
##   Till   Fert    total_yeild
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Chisel Broad          1491
## 2 Chisel Deep           1605
## 3 Chisel Surface        1577
## 4 Ridge  Broad          1408
## 5 Ridge  Deep           1710
## 6 Ridge  Surface        1685
```

## A data manipulation pipeline
Let's look at how to use this pipe operator effectively with dplyr functions, by re-writing the code below to use `%&gt;%`

.pull-left[

```r
crops &lt;- select(cropYield, -Field)
crops &lt;- filter(crops, Till %in% c("Ridge", "Chisel"))
crops &lt;- group_by(crops, Till, Fert)
summarize(crops, total_yeild = sum(Yield))
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
## # Groups:   Till [2]
##   Till   Fert    total_yeild
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Chisel Broad          1491
## 2 Chisel Deep           1605
## 3 Chisel Surface        1577
## 4 Ridge  Broad          1408
## 5 Ridge  Deep           1710
## 6 Ridge  Surface        1685
```

.pull-right[

```r
select(cropYield, -Field) %&gt;%
  filter(Till %in% c("Ridge", "Chisel")) %&gt;%
  group_by(Till, Fert) %&gt;%
  summarize(total_yeild = sum(Yield))
```
